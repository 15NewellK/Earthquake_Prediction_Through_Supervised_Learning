ReadNe

Welcome. This is a readme file for Kristian Newell's capstone project that was submitted to Brainstation's Data Science course.

The focus of this project was to use regression models to predict the depth and magnitude of earthquakes given the date, time, latitude, and longitude. The goal was to create a model that is able to act as a warning system to alert people of the potential of an upcoming dangerous earthquake in their area.

This repository 'Earthquake_Prediction_Through_Supervised_Learning' contains the following:

- 1 readme file
- 1 csv file titled earthquake_database containing data on all earthquakes with magnitude higher than 5.5 on a richter scale from 1960-2016
- 4 Jupyter Notebooks
- 1 Technical Summary Business report in PDF format


The 4 Jupyter Notebooks should be run in the order they are numbered in the title:
1. Preprocessing & Cleaning
2. Initial EDA
3. Feature Engineering 
4. Modelling and Findings


NOTE: In Notebook 4. Modeling and Findings there are 4 cells that can take several minutes to hours to run depending on computer processing strength, there is a warning note in the Notebook as well directly before these cells apear. Additionally there are several points throughout the notebooks that information is written to csv to be used in subsequent notebooks, so there will be errors in the notebooks if they are run in a different order than listed above.


All files in this notebook, with the exception of 4. Modeling, can be run in the base anaconda environment (Python 3 kernel). The modeling notebook requires 1 additional installation, which is included at the begining of the notebook.

If you are having trouble accessing any of the files within this folder please contact Kristian at 15NewellK@gmail.com.
