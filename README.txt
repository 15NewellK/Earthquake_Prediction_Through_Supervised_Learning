Welcome. This is a readme file for Kristian Newell's capstone project that was submitted to Brainstation's Data Science course.

The focus of this project was to use regression models to predict the depth and magnitude of earthquakes given the date, time, latitude, and longitude. The goal was to create a model that is able to act as a warning system to alert people of the potential of an upcoming dangerous earthquake in their area.

This repository 'Earthquake_Prediction_Through_Supervised_Learning' contains the following:

All files in this notebook, with the exception of 4. Modeling, can be run in the base anaconda environment (Python 3 kernel). The modeling notebook requires 1 additional installation, which is included at the begining of the notebook.

If you are having trouble accessing any of the files within this folder please contact Kristian at 15NewellK@gmail.com.
